Completed 2022 \
By **Clara Hong** (clarashong)

## Description

This fun shooter game project stars the beloved character Kirby by Masahiro Sakurai. 
The player fights Kirby-universe enemies in an effort to protect their precious ores. The game was practice and an opportunity to learn Greenfoot, 
object oriented programming, and game design. 
Kirby and its universe's characters belong to Nintendo and HAL's Labratory, I do not take any credit for character designs. 
I simply wanted to make a shooter game involving such beloved characters.
