# Kirby Star Defense
 Fan-made Kirby Shooter Game
 Completed 2022

## Description

This project is a fun shooter game starring the beloved character Kirby by Masahiro Sakurai. 
The player fights Kirby-universe enemies in an effort to protect their precious ores. The game was used as practice and an opportunity to learn Greenfoot, 
object oriented programming and game design. 
Kirby and its universe's characters belong to Nintendo and HAL's Labratory, I do not take any credit for character designs. 
I simply wanted to make a shooter game involving such beloved characters.
