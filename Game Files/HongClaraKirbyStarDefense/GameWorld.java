/**
 * GameWorld - where the main game takes place
 * Instructions: 
 * Goal of the game is to protect the rainbow ores that are lined up around 
 * the player. 
 * When one of the ores runs out of hp, the game ends and the player loses. 
 * The player wins when they have finished all the waves and the boss battle. 
 * The player controls their character (Kirby) with the arrow keys, and shoots 
 * with the space bar, and they must shoot the enemies who are trying to get to the 
 * ores to destroy them. 
 * 
 * Extra: 
 * -The bomb power up gets rid of all enemies on the battlefield(except the boss)
 * -The hammer heals all the ores
 * -The red star allows you to get rid of all enemies in a lane 
 * CHEAT KEYS: 
 * -Press "7" to go to wave seven (where all the types of powerups and enemies are available)
 * -PRESS 'b' TO SKIP TO BOSS BATTLE - You have to get rid of all the enemies first to see the boss. 
 * 
 * Credits: 
 * -Kirby and the other characters, including all the enemies and the boss,
 * are the intellectual property of Nintendo and HAL Labratory. 
 * -Imported ScoreBar class from Mr. Cohen's Bug Simulator. 
 * 
 * Images: 
 * -The characters, backgrounds, and ores were drawn by Clara. 
 * -Star image was found on purepng.com: https://purepng.com/photo/10375/clipart-gold-star
 * -Fire image was taken from pngtree.com: https://pngtree.com/freepng/orange-fire-ball-flame-clip-art_5566544.html
 * -The red star was drawn, by me, on photopea
 * -Bomb image is from clipart-library.com: http://clipart-library.com/clip-art/explosion-clipart-transparent-18.htm
 * -Hammer image is from custom-cursor.com: https://custom-cursor.com/en/collection/kirby/kirby-hummer
 * 
 * Music: all from https://www.chosic.com/free-music/all/
 * -The main theme is called "Christmas Town" by TRG Banks. Artist Contact -> https://trgbanks.bandcamp.com/
 * -Boss battle theme is called "Hostiles Inbound [Epic Battle Music â€“ Powerful Orchestral]"
 * by Miguel Johnson: Artist Contact -> https://soundcloud.com/migueljohnsonmjmusic
 * -Losing screen music is call "Simple Sadness" by Alexander Nakarada. Artist  Contact -> https://www.serpentsoundstudios.com
 * -Win music is called "Funny Bubbles" by Keys of Moon. Artist Contact -> https://soundcloud.com/keysofmoon
 * 
 * Sound Effects: all from mixkit.co 
 * This includes: 
 * -pop sound ("hard pop click")
 * -shooting sound ("short laser gun shot")
 * -exploding sound ("distant war explosions")
 * -magic hammer sound ("Magic sweep game trophy") 
 * 
 * Bugs: 
 * -If the player shoots the red star power-up, their star projectile just goes through the power-up and doesn't disappear 
 * -The wall's image state doesn't change back to "full" when the hammer is activated, but it will go back to the full image if hit by an enemy. 
 * -If you try to play again (from either of the ending screens), it might keep the red star power up.
